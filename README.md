The first time you build you will be asked to install dependencies using `npm`. e.g.

    npm install fs-extra
    npm install google-closure-compiler
    npm install preprocessor

Then, to execute a build of the engine to the build/output folder, do:

    cd build
    node build.js

See the built in help for more build instructions

    node build.js -h
